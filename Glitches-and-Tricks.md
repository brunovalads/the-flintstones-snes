#Glitches and Tricks

- Hold a stone on hand until it starts to burn, then you jump. Fred's face gets weird, and if you're still in the air when the stone overheat, the animation (overheat animation) happens way faster if you keep jumping. That's because the address $7E1DD5 (counter for how long you're holding the rock) is not reset to zero while in air.

- Throw cancel: release the X button right when you're about to land on ground, Fred won't throw the stone.

- Jumping to a ledge from behind you hit an invisible solid block.

- In Jungle 1, right after the 2 bridges, there's a Gorilla that spawns bellow the platform and falls down, in the pit on the right.

- If you're on the right ledge on the top of a Springboard contraption facing its center, you can activate it using a bowling ball. Fred's x pos must be > than springboard x pos + 12 for this trick to work (and < than springboard x pos + 25, leading to a 12 pixels window). Also, sometimes the accumulated x pos is reseted to zero with this trick.

- In the Password screen, Fred creates the dust from walking, but it's invisible, static, and lasts forever.

- Throwing a stone when sticked to a wall makes it falls straight down and passing through the floor.

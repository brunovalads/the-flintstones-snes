- Hold a stone on hand until it starts to burn, then you jump. Fred's face gets weird, and if you're still in the air when the stone overheat, the animation (overheat animation) happens way faster if you keep jumping. That's because the address $7E1DD5 (counter for how long you're holding the rock) is not reset to zero while in air.<br>

- Throw cancel: release the X button right when you're about to land on ground, Fred won't throw the stone. There's a 22 frame window for this trick.<br>

- If you're on the right ledge on the top of a Springboard contraption facing its center, you can activate it using a bowling ball. Fred's x pos must be > than springboard x pos + 12 for this trick to work (and < than springboard x pos + 25, leading to a 12 pixels window). Also, sometimes the accumulated x pos is reseted to zero with this trick.<br>

- Throwing a stone when sticked to a wall makes it falls straight down and passing through the floor. You can do this from sticked to the wall to 12 pixels away from it.<br>

# The Flintstones - Snes
This repository contains all my research on The Flintstones (U), for Snes.

I started it on October 4th, 2015, with the purpose of making a TAS (on Lsnes-rr2), so I'm [mapping the RAM](/RAM_Map.md) to create a [lua script](/The-Flintstones-Utils.lua) to help the speedrun process. There's a basic [RAM watch file](/RAM_Watch.wch) to use on Snes9x and BizHawk. Also, I'll document any mechanic aspect of the game, as well glitches I may find through the process.

Later, I'll edit the [Game Resources](http://tasvideos.org/GameResources/SNES/TheFlintstones.html) page of this game on TASVideos with, basicaly, the same content of this repository, to serve as a base to my future submission.
